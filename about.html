        <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>To support young athletes living in Chicago's northside neighborhoods, 
                    who have an interest in learning and playing soccer, 
                    specifically those skills around team   cooperation and good sportsmanship.</p> 
         <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League aspires to develop strong,
                     well-rounded, and mindful athletes through the building of character,
                      self-discipline, and leadership.</p>
         <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p> The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes
                     residing in Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn
                      and play soccer. To be a member of  NYSL, you must be between the ages of 4-12
                       and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL is ran by a small full-time staff,
                        and relies on  the generous volunteer time of parents and previous league members.</p>
